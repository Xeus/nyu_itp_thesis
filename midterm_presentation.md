One specific piece of feedback I'd like for what I'm working on next: if you were to compile a list of tests, achievements, work experience, recommendations that would sum up how experienced someone is at a given profession, what would they be?

I have a list of professions like designer, professor, financier, business analyst, etc., and I'm looking to develop milestones and steps generalized for people in that profession that they all acknowledge signal a more experienced individual.  Any feedback on this would be appreciated.

Thanks again.
