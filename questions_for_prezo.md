# Questions for the Presentation

## What is the central question or theme of your thesis?  What is the thing that's driving it?

The central theme of my thesis revolves around reputation and identity.  How much of our lives is not represented in any way right now, and how much benefit would we get from combining different sectors of our lives together?

## Brief synopsis of the story of your project.

In 2006 I came up with the idea and sent it to my old Army buddy Chris.  We have talked about it since then, during the Moneyball book days, the heyday of no limit hold 'em, the NBA statistical revolution, our transitioning out of the Army into a different sector.  I've applied to incubators, sought funding and interest, and haven't received anything so far, but it is the holy grail for me in terms of what I really want to spend my life working on and what sorts of things I want to see online.

## What is your big reveal/the gestalt of it?

The reveal for me is to show how reputation can be quantified for one individual but then ramp it up to the internal metrics for the organization he works for, and then for the country he lives in and the tribes he belongs to, to show how reputation is communitized and a powerful feedback mechanism.

## How do you get people into your world?

I plan on working on the world on my own time, regardless of its own success, but I'll post it to the quantified self community.

## What are the most compelling parts of your project/process for you and what will those be for the audience?

The most compelling part of this for the audience is to show them immediate results using their own data in a way that they've never seen before, i.e. showing how their perception of themselves lines up with reality.

## What are your supporting materials? (photo, video, audio)

I have a pitch deck with screenshots and drawn mock-ups of the site and where I hope it will be eventually.

## What were the main surprises and discoveries?

The main discovery was finding out just how much infrastructure has to be built before one can start creating metrics for happiness, success, etc.  After 7 years I am barely scratching the surface, both theoretically and algorithmically.

The surprise is mostly how I've come to accept that this project is a life-love, and that I want to build it so it enables things in my own life.

## What are your next steps/future of the project?

The next step is to continue to refine the project gradually in my free time so that eventually it can become bulletproof and I can continue to pull in data and make the site more useful for myself. 

## What presentation format are you going to use?

I plan to tell my life story and how it relates to reputation, and then talk about what I'm looking for from the world, and then where I think other people might see the same world, and then I want to show the site and what I've been doing to bring a reality of a Galapag.us tribe of openness, transparency, and comparison to life.
