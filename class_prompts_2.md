# Week #2: Thesis Class Question Prompts

"Of all the things you're interested in, what are the 3 top things you're most excited about?"

* Figuring out the relative valuations of peoples' reputations between their own perspectives others' perspectives of them.
* Creating an easy-to-understand a-ha demo to show that will convey the low barrier to entry for using the site as well as its scalability and complexity on the back-end.
* Having a widget or business card or small display that shows an example reputation in its simplest, most physical or visible form in order to convey the breadth of information in a real-world use case.

"Make a list of the aspects of your project you're most comfortable with, and least comfortable with."

Most comfortable with:

* the theories behind reputation, identity, privacy, publicy, anonymity, pseudonymity, etc.
* web site architecture
* leading a tribe of Galapag.users and quantified selfers

Least comfortable with:

* web site UI and UX
* evaluating what components of the site/demo will resonate most with users or during a presentation
* pitching the idea cold
* convincing people to join the tribe
* user testing

"How will you accomplish the goals of your project?"

* build as much low-level data entry into the project as possible so that emergent properties of comparing/mixing data will emerge.
* have a workable site as early as possible to begin user testing on thesis classmates and ITP student base
* cram all the features into the site ASAP so that some can be combined and the UI can be simplified down to much fewer components, even to a command line

"What will you be bringing in for week #3 to show a representation of your project?"

* I have a workable site that I can demonstrate via mock-ups of different areas of Galapag.us.
